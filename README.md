# Dotfiles
My hyprland dots (mix of jakoolit and binnewbs) to restore on a new system
You shouldn't use this as it's not the "nicest" setup, however i like this alot, wallpapers were gathered from various places therefore i've decided not to post them.

# Installation
Read **~/.config/hypr/configs/Keybinds.conf** and **~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/UserKeybinds.conf** for keybinds
Clone the git and copy the files into ~/.config/

# Credits
╺╸[JaKooLit](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots) for most of the files.  
╺╸[Binnewbs](https://github.com/binnewbs/arch-hyprland) for the Waybar configuration.

# Pictures
Shows cava, btop, tty clock, and pipes.
