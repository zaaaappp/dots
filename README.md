# Dotfiles
My hyprland dots (mix of jakoolit and binnewbs) to restore on a new system
You shouldn't use this as it's not the "nicest" setup, however i like this alot, wallpapers were gathered from various places therefore i've decided not to post them.
Read **~/.config/hypr/configs/Keybinds.conf** and **~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/UserKeybinds.conf** for keybinds
