# Dotfiles
My hyprland dots (mix of JaKooLit and binnewbs) for me to restore on a new system
You shouldn't use this as it's not the "nicest" setup, however i like this alot, wallpapers were gathered from various places therefore i've decided not to post them.

# Installation
Read **~/.config/hypr/configs/Keybinds.conf** and **~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/UserKeybinds.conf** for keybinds
Clone the git and copy the files into **~/.config/**, then edit **~.config/hyprland.conf** and adjust it to your monitors (list monitors with hyprctl monitors)
